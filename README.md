#  Smart Heating Load Prediction

> A machine learning-powered web application that accurately predicts the heating load required by buildings based on architectural and environmental parameters. This project promotes energy-efficient construction and sustainable design planning.

##  About the Project

Buildings with poor insulation or design consume more energy for heating.  
**Smart Heating Load Prediction** helps architects, engineers, and planners estimate heating load requirements during early design phases.

It uses machine learning models trained on the **UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset** to predict the heating load based on:

- Relative compactness
- Surface area
- Wall area
- Roof area
- Overall height
- Glazing area
- Orientation
- Glazing area distribution

This tool makes heating load predictions accessible through a **user-friendly Flask-based web interface**.
